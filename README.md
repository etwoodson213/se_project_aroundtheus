**Intro**
  
The project "Around The U.S." was created with the aim to utilize the skills acquired from past projects and to learn new ones. This particular project heavily relied on flexbox, grid, UL, and media queries, which were blended together to develop a responsive and adaptable website that can be viewed on various devices. The video below demonstrates how the website looks on different screens.

Over the course of this project's development, new skills in JavaScript were implemented to enable interactivity on the page. Event listeners were added to allow users to add new photos, like photos, and remove photos. The skills to dynamically modify the DOM and store data were critical in enabling these features.
